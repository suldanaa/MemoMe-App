## Overview

### Description

A journal app where you're encouraged to add your entries, and look back on your entries throughout the years.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Real-time logging of your enteries gives this app a particular need for it to be a mobile app. It wouldn't be able to be a website and hold the same purpose.
- **Story:** We live in a time where many life-documentation through apps is common yet based around social engagement. Locket, instagram, snapchat. We have very few apps where the main goal is to document things for your own interest in looking back at what you were thinking earlier in the year.
- **Market:** Those who love journaling and life-documentation, but want a more private and accessible way to do such a thing.
- **Habit:** People will use this to reflect on their day, once a day. Everyday.
- **Scope:** I have a very clear view of the app, since it's built similary to a to-do list we created. I understand how to implement a calender view, persistent data, etc.
